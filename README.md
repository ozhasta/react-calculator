## Live Demo

Live demo here: :arrow_right: [React Calculator](https://calc-project-react.netlify.app/)

## Description

I used useReducer, useEffect hooks in this project. Implemented CSS grid system.
You can chain multiple calculations like: 30 + 12 * 3 - 1, also It's working with decimal points.
There is functionality to use it with a keyboard or mouse (in mobile touching).

I ported my own vanilla JS version to React.
